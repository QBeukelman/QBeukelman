ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I'm an experienced **Software Engineer** and graduate student from **Codam Amsterdam**, with a strong foundation in systems programming and a passion for building reliable, scalable software â€” from low-level C to cloud-native Java applications on AWS.

At **Codam**, I built projects including a custom [bash shell](https://github.com/QBeukelman/minishell) and a low-level [rendering engine](https://github.com/QBeukelman/Ray-Tracer) in C, gaining deep experience with memory management, parsing, and performance optimization.

At [ASB Bank](https://www.asnbank.nl/) (formerly de Volksbank), I worked for over 2 years on back-end services in Java and AWS, including a `Kafka`-powered loader into an `RDS`-`PostgreSQL` table and a `Lambda API` for transaction search and retrieval used by mobile and web clients, the **Transaction Data Store**.

At the **University of Amsterdam**, I built a content recommendation and ranking system [UvA Recommender Systems](https://github.com/QBeukelman/UvA-Recommender-Systems) in Python using `collaborative filtering` with cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and Pearson correlation.

On iOS, I contributed features to the [ASN Bank app](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/asn-bank/id1585770794?l=en-GB), including **Overzicht Aanpassen** and **Snel Saldo Verbergen**, and published personal apps like [Simple Clock](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/simple-clock-widget/id6468964766?l=en-GB) to the App Store.
